# MAIN MISSION - Automated Website Generation Business

## Core Vision: $100k+/Year Automated Website Business

**Primary Goal**: Create a fully automated website generation system that produces complete restaurant websites from client data with minimal manual intervention.

## Complete Automated Workflow

### 1. Client Data Collection (100% Upfront)
**Website Form with Validation Logic:**
- Client accesses data collection website
- Comprehensive form captures all required information:
  - Restaurant details (name, address, phone, hours, etc.)
  - Menu items, prices, descriptions, categories
  - Brand preferences (colors, style, atmosphere)
  - Business story, about section content
  - Contact information, social media links
  - Template selection from available options
- **Validation enforces completeness** - no partial submissions
- **Image upload requirements** with specifications clearly defined
- **No work begins until ALL data is provided**

### 2. Required Client Assets (All or Nothing)
**Image Asset List Provided to Client:**
- Logo (PNG with transparent background)
- Hero/banner images (1200x800px minimum)
- Menu item photos (400x300px each)
- Interior/exterior restaurant photos
- Staff/chef photos (optional)
- About section images

**Business Rule**: Only proceed when 100% of assets are uploaded and validated.

### 3. Automated Website Generation
**Script-Driven Process:**
1. **Data Intake**: Client form data â†’ structured JSON/database
2. **Template Selection**: Chosen template copied to client project folder
3. **Content Injection**: Scripts replace all {{PLACEHOLDER}} variables with client data
4. **Image Integration**: Client images automatically optimized and placed
5. **Style Application**: Color scheme and customizations applied
6. **Quality Validation**: Automated testing for responsiveness, performance
7. **Package Generation**: Complete website bundled for delivery

### 4. Complete Delivery Package
**What Client Receives:**
- **Complete website files** (HTML, CSS, JS, images)
- **All documentation** for hosting and maintenance
- **Asset optimization** (images compressed, code minified)
- **Hosting instructions** (domain setup, file upload guides)
- **One revision round included** ($100 for additional changes)

### 5. Business Boundaries (Strict Enforcement)
**No Exceptions Policy:**
- **No work without complete data** - timer doesn't start until everything is provided
- **Maximum one revision round** included in base price
- **$100 per additional revision** after delivery
- **No ongoing support** - clean handoff with documentation
- **No custom development** - template-based only
- **Payment required upfront** before any work begins

## Revenue Model

### Pricing Structure
- **Base Price**: $1,000 per website
- **Negotiation Range**: $800-900 minimum
- **Revision Fee**: $100 each (post-delivery)
- **Rush Fee**: +$200 for 24-hour delivery (optional)

### Volume Targets
- **Target**: 2-3 websites per week
- **Monthly Revenue**: $8,000-12,000
- **Annual Goal**: $100,000+
- **Efficiency**: 2-3 hours work per $800-1000 project
