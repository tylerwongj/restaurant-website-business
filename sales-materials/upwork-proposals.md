## Template 5: Value Comparison

Hi [Client Name],

You're probably wondering why my restaurant websites are $1,000 when agencies charge $5,000+.

**Here's the difference:**
- **Agencies:** Custom design, 6-8 weeks, lots of meetings
- **Me:** Template-based, 48-72 hours, efficient process

**You still get:**
✓ Professional, custom-coded website
✓ Lightning-fast loading speeds
✓ Mobile optimization
✓ All the features restaurants need

**What you don't get:**
✗ Endless design meetings
✗ 2-month timeline
✗ $5,000 price tag

**Perfect for:**
- New restaurants needing to get online fast
- Existing restaurants with slow/outdated sites
- Anyone who values efficiency over endless customization
